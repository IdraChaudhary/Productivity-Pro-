# System Architecture

## Overview

Productivity Pro follows a modern client-side architecture with clear separation of concerns and intelligent data management.

## Architecture Layers

### Presentation Layer
- User interface components
- Responsive design system
- Event handling
- Animation system

### Application Layer
- Task management logic
- State management
- Data validation
- Business rules

### Data Layer
- Local storage management
- Data persistence
- Cache management
- Backup systems

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with UI
2. Events are processed by controllers
3. Business logic validates and processes
4. Data is persisted to storage
5. UI updates reflect changes

## Technical Specifications

### Storage Schema
```javascript
{
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "timestamp",
      text: "string",
      completed: "boolean",
      createdAt: "ISOString",
      completedAt: "ISOString"
    }
  ],
  settings: {
    theme: "string",
    filter: "string"
  }
}
Performance Considerations
-Efficient DOM updates

-Minimal re-renders

-Optimized event handlers

-Memory management
